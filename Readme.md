big_lang_cc is a a compiler for object-oriented language, it includes almost all object-oriented features. The compiler implements all core technologies, including:
1.  Object-oriented inheritance.
2.  Object-oriented overloading.
3.  Object-oriented polymorphism. (virtual methods)
4.  Extended native interfaces.
5.  Rich data types.
6.  Check definition order of local variables.
7.  Firstly use classes and then define them.
8.  Firstly use fields of a class and then define them.
9.  Flow control statement.
10. Break and continue statements.
11. Basic expression grammars.
12. Type upward cast and downward cast.
13. Rich field access function.
14. Rich method access function.
15. embedded nasm statements.
16. Multiple threads.
17. Synchronized classes.
18. Try-catch-finally exception process.
19. Exception stack.
20. Array expressions.
21. Command line parameters.
22. Static variables in a method.
23. Static variables in a block.
24. Static fields in a class.
25. Static methods in a class.
